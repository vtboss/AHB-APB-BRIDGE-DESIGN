### **PART 2: Report Assembly Phase (You - 1-2 hours)**

**What You Will Do:**
1. **Take the professional report template** (`Part2-Report-Template.md`)
2. **Find and replace all placeholders** with actual data from Part 1:
   - Replace `[INSERT_MAX_FREQUENCY]` with actual frequency from ISE
   - Replace `[INSERT_LUT_PERCENTAGE]` with actual utilization percentage
   - Insert waveform images in designated locations
   - Fill in all technical tables with real synthesis data
3. **Add your analysis and interpretation** of the results
4. **Customize conclusions** based on actual performance achieved

**Your Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Complete technical report (15-20 pages)
- ‚úÖ All placeholders replaced with real data  
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting and presentation
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard technical documentation

### **PART 3: Quality Verification Phase (You - 30 minutes)**

**What You Will Do:**
1. **Use the verification checklist** to validate report completeness
2. **Cross-check technical data** for consistency and accuracy
3. **Verify professional formatting** and presentation standards
4. **Final quality assurance** before submission

**Final Deliverables:**
- ‚úÖ Verified professional report ready for Maven Silicon submission
- ‚úÖ Portfolio-quality technical documentation
- ‚úÖ Job-application-ready quantified achievements
- ‚úÖ Industry-standard VLSI design experience
