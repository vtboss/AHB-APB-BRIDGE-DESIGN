- [ ] Frequency × period should equal ~1000 (MHz × ns = 1000)
- [ ] Example: 125 MHz × 8 ns = 1000 ✅

#### Resource Utilization Logic Check
- [ ] Higher LUT count should correlate with more functionality
- [ ] FF count should be roughly 40-80% of LUT count for this design
- [ ] Slice count should be roughly 60-90% of LUT count
- [ ] BRAM usage should be 0-1 for basic bridge design

#### Power Consumption Reality Check  
- [ ] Higher frequency → higher dynamic power (should correlate)
- [ ] More resources → higher total power (should correlate)
- [ ] Static power should be 15-40% of total power
- [ ] Clock power should be significant portion of dynamic power

### Waveform Technical Validation

#### AHB Protocol Compliance
- [ ] HTRANS changes before HADDR (address phase)
- [ ] HWDATA valid in cycle after HADDR (data phase)
- [ ] HREADY controls transaction completion
- [ ] HRESP shows OKAY (2'b00) for successful transactions

#### APB Protocol Compliance  
- [ ] PSEL asserted in setup phase, PENABLE=0
- [ ] PENABLE asserted in access phase

- [ ] Setup → Access → Idle sequence is correct

#### State Machine Validation
- [ ] State transitions follow ST_IDLE → ST_SETUP → ST_ACCESS → ST_IDLE
- [ ] State encoding matches your Verilog (check binary values)
- [ ] State changes occur on clock edges
- [ ] Reset behavior shows return to ST_IDLE

## 🔧 SECTION 5: FINAL TECHNICAL REVIEW

### Design Validation Questions

Answer these to ensure technical correctness:

1. **Does your maximum frequency make sense?**
   - [ ] 50-200 MHz range is typical for this design
   - [ ] Higher frequency = more challenging timing

2. **Are your resource numbers realistic?**
   - [ ] Simple bridge should use <1% of large FPGA
   - [ ] Complex bridge might use 2-5% of resources

3. **Do timing violations make sense?**
   - [ ] Zero violations = excellent design
   - [ ] Small violations might be acceptable with explanation

4. **Is power consumption reasonable?**
   - [ ] Higher frequency and more resources = more power
   - [ ] 50-500mW range is typical

5. **Do waveforms show correct behavior?**
   - [ ] Protocol sequences are correct
   - [ ] Timing relationships are proper
   - [ ] Signal values are logical

### Performance Benchmarking
Compare your results to these typical ranges:

| Metric | Good | Excellent | Your Result |
|--------|------|-----------|-------------|
| Frequency | 80-120 MHz | >120 MHz | _______ MHz |
| LUT Utilization | <15% | <10% | _______% |  
| Timing Slack | >1ns | >3ns | _______ ns |
